A simple neural network library written in V

This is a simple personal project, helping me understand how neural networks work by building one.

**THIS LIBRARY IS NOT INTENDED FOR PRODUCTION USE**

## Features

- [x] Simple neural networks taking in 1D f64 tensors as inputs, with as many layers as you want
- [x] sigmoid, relu, and tanh ativation functions
- [x] square-mean and logloss loss functions
- [ ] simple gradient descent backpropagation algorithm
- [x] the ability to save a network as a zip file to train it, and later reuse it
